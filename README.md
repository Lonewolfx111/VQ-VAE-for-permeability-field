# VQ-VAE-for-permeability-field
In the field of machine learning and deep learning, the Autoencoder is a common neural network architecture used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and generative data.The Variational Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is an extension of the Autoencoder that combines the Variational Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Quantisation and has achieved significant success in areas such as image generation. Its design is inspired by VAE and Quantisation methods and combines their strengths to enable VQ-VAE to generate high quality data and introduce discretisation into the data representation.
VQ-VAE can also be a universal deep learning model for geology problems, which can be used in reducing dimension and constructing surrogate models.In this part, we provide a simple VQ-VAE model for Gaussian field reconstruction.
By the way, if u are interested in applying deep learning models for geology problems, u can contact me (zhangxingyuan2001@gmail.com)
